# **Linked List**
Linked lists are a fundamental data structure that allows efficient storage and manipulation of data


## **Explanation**

1. ### **Linear Linked List**
    A linear linked list consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node. The menu-driven code for a linear linked list typically includes options to perform operations such as inserting a node, deleting a node, searching for a specific value, displaying the list, and exiting the program.

2. ### **Doubly Linked List**
    A doubly linked list extends the concept of a linear linked list by including an additional pointer in each node, pointing to the previous node. The menu-driven code for a doubly linked list provides options for inserting, deleting, searching, displaying, and exiting, similar to a linear linked list. However, due to the presence of backward links, the code must handle operations involving both forward and backward traversal.
